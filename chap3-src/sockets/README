This directory contains DateServer.java and DateClient.java. These programs can be run by
first compiling both files and then entering

	java DateServer

to start the server and

	java DateClient

to start the client. 

It is possible to start the server and then connect to it by using telnet.  After
starting the server, enter

	telnet <hostname> 6013

where <hostname> is the IP name or address the server is running on. If the server is running
on the same computer as telnet is being issued from, enter

	telnet localhost 6013
