Instructions for running RMI source code examples.
--------------------------------------------------

This is organized into three directories:

(1) client - which contains the RMIClient code.

(2) server - which contains the RemoteDate interface and implementation.

(3) rmi-callback - which provides an example of performing an RMI callback (this is an example that is not in the text.) A callback allows the server to invoke a remote method on the client.

Compilation instructions for the rmi-callback example are contained in the README in the rmi-callback directory.

To run the remote date  files

SERVER
------
1. Compile all source files.

2. Generate the stub and skeleton class files using RMIC (This is only necessary for those using
pre-Java 5.0 compilers.)

	rmic RemoteDateImpl

3. Start the registry (rmiregistry)

On UNIX/Linux/OS X, enter

	rmiregistry &

On Windows, enter

	start rmiregistry

4. Create the remote object 

	java RemoteDateImpl

This registers the remote date on the server with the RMI registry.

CLIENT
------

*** Make sure the files RemoteDate.class and RemoteDateImpl_Stub.class are in the client directory!!!

1. Compile RemoteDate.java

2. Start the client

	java RMIClient


It is possible to have the server download the class files to the client. For
details how to do this, please consult the RMI homepage at
