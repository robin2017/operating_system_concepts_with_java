Instructions for running RMI source code examples.
--------------------------------------------------

1. Compile all source files.

2. Generate the stub and skeleton class files using RMIC.

	rmic RemoteDateImpl

	rmic DateObjectImpl

3. Start the registry (rmiregistry)

On UNIX/Linux/OS X, enter

	rmiregistry &

On Windows, enter

	start rmiregistry

4. Create the remote object 

	java RemoteDateImpl

This registers the remote date on the server with the RMI registry.

5. Start the client

	java Client <host address>

i.e.

	java Client 127.0.0.1


It is possible to have the server download the class files to the client. For
details how to do this, please consult the RMI homepage at
