/**
 * This service class fulfills transactions which are performed by separate threads. Because a transaction
 * may result in an error, we need to record the error. However, since there is only a static instance
 * of this class, there is only one copy of errorCode. If an error occurs in one thread, it will set
 * the value of errorCode, however another thread may set it to a different value. The solution to this
 * is to use ThreadLocal copies of errorCode. Every thread that causes an error will set its own
 * copy of errorCode.
 *
 * In Java the use of thread local data is not as obvious. For example, you could subclass the Thread
 * class and declare instance data that provides a separate copy for each thread. However, if you do
 * not have control over the thread creation process (i.e. you are using a thread pool), then you must
 * use a strategy such as thread local data.
